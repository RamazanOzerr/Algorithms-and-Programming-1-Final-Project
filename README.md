# about
Kare Kapan is a strategy game played with 2 people. The game board consists of 42 squares formed by 7 horizontal and 8 vertical lines. The game is played with 28 white and 28 black stones. The aim of the game is to reduce the opponent's stones to 3.

The player who plays with white stones starts first. The player whose turn it is tries to obtain a square by placing a stone at any intersection of the lines. Stones are placed in turn until all the stones are placed. No stone can be moved or used to make a move until all stones are placed.

After all stones are placed, players count the squares they have obtained and choose a rival stone to remove from the game for each square they have obtained. If neither player has obtained any squares, the first player (the player with the white stones) removes one of the opponent's stones from the game. When selecting a rival stone to remove from the game at any stage of the game, the squares formed must not be disturbed.

Then, the player whose turn it is tries to create a square by moving one of their stones. The stone with an empty space in front can be moved horizontally or vertically as desired, but it cannot be jumped over. When a new square is created, a rival stone is chosen and removed from the game. The player who reduces the opponent's stones to 3 wins the game.
